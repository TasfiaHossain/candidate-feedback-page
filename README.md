# candidate-feedback-page

This is what I have so far for the interviewer feedback page and the TA feedback page. Up until this point both pages will look the same and then I need to add the scroll bar, add buttons, review notes, link the pages, and code the entire interview section of the page. This should be done and finalized by the end of Monday.
